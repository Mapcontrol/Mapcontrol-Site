      <p>We're empowering gaming for enterprise.</p>
      <h4 class="reenter-text pb-3">What We Believe About Gaming</h4>
      <p>We believe that gaming skillsets can be critical assets in tackling the complex problems of our world.</p>
      <p>Video games are considered entertainment technology for consumer play. But in our complex world, games and gamers have vast potential to contribute to enterprise decision-making.</p>
      <p>Games like StarCraft II train problem-solving skills that are valuable in the real world. Building coherent strategies from limited data, adapting to new events at the needed speed, and decomposing your own performance to thrive in environments with low feedback are some of the skills gamers have honed.</p>
      <img src="mapstack.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 2rem; padding-bottom: 3rem"></img>
      <h4 class="reenter-text pb-3">What We Do</h4>
      <p>We research and provide coaching on the application of gaming skillsets and technology to impactful problems and careers.</p>
      <p>Leading organizations have started to hire gamers for their problem-solving skills. But there exist no tools that would enable the interaction between gamers and organizations to intensify and scale.</p>
      <p>With Mapcontrol, we aim to build these tools and empower gaming for enterprise. In the process, we research and provide coaching on the skills that games like StarCraft train, how gaming skills can be transferred to real-world problems, and how they can best be presented and assessed in interviews.</p>
      <h4 class="reenter-text pb-3">Collaboration</h4>
      <p>Gaming is all about collaboration. So is gaming for enterprise.</p>
      <p>Whether you're a gamer excited about applying your gaming skills to your career, or you're working for an organization excited about the potential of gaming for enterprise, we'd love to chat. To learn more about our research and how we want to bring gaming to enterprise, you can reach out to our team at <a href="">hi@mapcontro.io</a>.</p>
      <h4 class="reenter-text pb-3">Where We Started</h4>
      <p>Mapcontrol is based on a course we created at Johns Hopkins University that used StarCraft II to teach early-career professionals about computational decision-making. We bootstrapped the course for one year and spent another year teaching it as an accredited professional development course before starting Mapcontrol.</p>
      <p>We empowered professionals with gaming. Now we're using our experience to empower gaming for enterprise.</p>
